# Tam's android diary (memory/mood calendar)

This is an android app made to help save events happening in your life, in a way that allows you to easily see how the events made you feel over the months.
All events have a mood with a color of your choosing which is then displayed in a calendar view.

This app also allows you to track your moods and anything that you feel is connected to them. 
For example: how good you slept, levels of back pain, or amount of social interactions.
You can create your own categories to track with your own scale of values - category: quality of sleep, scale values: bad (red color), neutral (yellow), 
good (green), good with dreams (cyan), nightmares (purple), ...

Through the in-app options, you can export everything you saved into files and reimport them later or to another device or back-up to your personal cloud storage.

This project is very early in development as a passion project (primarily) for personal use and learning of developing android apps. Development started 04/2023.
